macOS Services for Alfred
=========================

Run macOS services via Alfred.

This workflow can execute macOS services on the clipboard contents, current selection or files (via an Alfred File Action).


Usage
-----

When run via keyword (`services` by default), you can choose from services that are applicable to the current contents of the general pasteboard. There is also a Hotkey to run the workflow with the current pasteboard.

Alternatively, you can call the workflow via its File Action (called "macOS Services") to run a service with the selected files, or use the second Hotkey to run the workflow on the current macOS selection.

Finally, you can assign your own Hotkeys to specific services (though this only works with the pasteboard contents).
